# Things for the Pi

A couple of random projects to put in a Raspberry Pi with a small touch display; the display might not be the main 
input/output device for them.

## Common Places

I am a regular Uber user but normally my destinations are always the same but I have to input the same information again and
again, the idea is to create a simple web interface that I can use from the small touch display to ask for an Uber ride
between regular locations.
